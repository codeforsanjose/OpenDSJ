OpenDSJ
=======

This app will outline raw information about the 2014 San Jose California Mayoral race contributions. This app was inspired by [opendisclosure.io.](http://www.opendisclosure.io)

Version one finished! Here’s how we did it:
- We used publically available campaign finance data. 
- We use R scripts to clean the data and aggregate amounts by zip code.
- We built from scratch a CSS/JavaScript website
- and used a free map service, CartoDB.

Final project visible [here](http://www.codeforsanjose.com/opendisclosure/)

Issues:
this is only a one snapshot picture of the race --- doesn’t pull ongoing updated data -- we would like to display data over time
CartoDB is not free and not a long-term option.
We did not fully understand the campaign finance data and we could not find a key to explain what each of the data types mean.

Version 2 is being built right now.

Cheers!
