OpenDSJ
=======

This app will outline raw information about the 2014 San Jose California Mayoral race contributions. This app was inspired by opendisclosure.io.

Version one finished! here’s how we did it:
We used publically available campaign finance data. 
We use R scripts to clean the data and aggregate amounts by zip code.
We built from scratch a CSS/JavaScript website and used a free map service, CartoDB.

Issues:
this is only a one snapshot picture of the race --- doesn’t pull ongoing updated data -- we would like to display data over time
CartoDB has issues.
Fully understanding the campaign finance data was difficult, there is no key on the data files that explains what each of the data types mean (named cryptic names, etc.)

Version 2 is being built right now.

Cheers!
