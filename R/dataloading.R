#The rest of the PAC money has gone to support Santa Clara County Supervisor Dave Cortese. His mayoral bid has gotten a $245,000 boost from local unions such as police officers and firefighters. Included in the tally are $50,000 from the city's two casinos, forbidden by San Jose law from donating directly to candidates. That's on top of the $567,000 in direct contributions Cortese has received, much of which also came from unions.
